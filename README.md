# Open Store Workflows

Reusable, data-driven workflows for planning and operating a store. Business rules live in code; asset records, prices, partners and approvals come from the operator's own sources.

This first implementation includes the shared core and the **store-concept** workflow. It produces a versioned `StoreSpec` from a concept brief, calculation templates, menus, site requirements and operating-store actuals. The other six workflow implementations and production-system integration are separate work.

## Packages

| Package | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `@osw/core` | Schemas, hashing, units, money, conditions, parameter resolution, asset sources and artifact contracts |
| `@osw/store-concept` | Concept selection, menus, investment and breakeven calculations, calibration, site requirements and release approval |
| `@osw/mcp` | A stdio MCP server exposing the same steps and schemas as the CLI |

The portable core and workflow have no Node builtin dependency. File access and command-line execution live in `@osw/core/node`; the HTTP client lives in `@osw/core/http`. Workflow packages import only `@osw/core`.

## Local development

Use Node.js 22 or later and the pnpm version declared in `package.json`.

```sh
corepack enable
git clone https://github.com/iCookCloud/open-store-workflows.git
cd open-store-workflows
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm build
pnpm test
```

Run the synthetic example without approvals to inspect its blocking needs (exit code `2`):

```sh
pnpm osw store-concept run \
  --assets examples/sample-store/assets \
  --in examples/sample-store/inputs/store-concept.json \
  --now 2026-01-01T00:00:00Z \
  --actor example:reviewer \
  --out-dir .osw/pending
```

Then use the example approvals (exit code `0`):

```sh
pnpm osw store-concept run \
  --assets examples/sample-store/assets \
  --in examples/sample-store/inputs/store-concept.json \
  --approvals examples/sample-store/approvals/store-concept.json \
  --now 2026-01-01T00:00:00Z \
  --actor example:reviewer \
  --out-dir .osw/approved
```

The output directory contains each step result, `result.json`, and `artifact.json`. A blocked run writes `null` to `artifact.json`; a step not reached in the current run has a `null` step file. Reusing an output directory therefore cannot expose a prior successful artifact as the current result. Commands do not write back to asset sources unless `--record` is passed. Exit code `1` indicates an execution error; `3` means the workflow produced output but one or more requested writebacks did not succeed.

```sh
pnpm osw slots --json-schema .osw/schemas
OSW_ASSETS=examples/sample-store/assets node packages/mcp/dist/stdio.js
```

The MCP server discovers installed `@osw/*` workflow packages. Its query tool limits pages to 50 records. Writeback tools are registered only when the server is started with `--allow-record`. HTTP credentials are read from `OSW_TOKEN`, never from committed inputs. FileSource writebacks use the system `flock` command for cross-process locking; reading files does not require it. If `flock` is unavailable, writes fail explicitly instead of proceeding without a lock.

## Semantics that matter

- Missing or ambiguous business parameters produce structured `needs`. There are no fallback business prices, exchange rates or operating assumptions in code.
- Approval binds to the hash of the approved content. Changing a menu or final specification requires a fresh matching approval.
- Steps read assets and return verification and fill intentions. The runner performs explicitly requested writes.
- Asset hashes supplied by a source are authoritative, including when fields have been redacted. Incompatible slot major versions fail explicitly.
- Monetary amounts are rounded by currency at line level. Overrides are already in the requested output currency.
- Calibration excludes a template's own source stores and does not verify a user override against the template.
- The source protocol uses bounded filtering and cursor pagination. Unknown fields and unsupported operations are rejected.

## Verification and synthetic data

```sh
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm boundaries
pnpm runtime
pnpm examples
```

`examples/sample-store` describes **Example Noodle Bar** in synthetic jurisdiction `XE`. Its records are generated from invented constants and a fixed seed; they are not anonymized production data. `pnpm examples` regenerates fixtures in a separate temporary directory, compares the committed golden output, exercises the approval gate, and records a deliberately failing verification. Regenerate committed fixtures intentionally with `node scripts/gen-examples.mjs` and review changes.

The privacy gate requires a nonempty denylist outside the repository. Put one literal per line, or prefix a regular expression with `re:`. Literal matching normalizes Unicode width, case and whitespace. General credential, path, contact and domain checks always run.

```sh
export OSW_PRIVATE_DENYLIST=/secure/workflow-denylist.txt
pnpm scan
node scripts/scan-private.mjs --history
node scripts/scan-private.mjs --tarball /secure/package.tgz
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

The pre-push hook scans the blobs reachable from outgoing commits; the full-history mode scans all local refs. GitHub Actions runs build, tests and examples for pushes and pull requests. The main-branch privacy job requires the `OSW_PRIVATE_DENYLIST_CONTENT` repository secret and scans the complete history. Private denylist values are never passed to pull-request jobs. The optional Woodpecker pipeline uses an `osw_private_denylist` secret. Without a configured denylist, scanning fails closed. npm publication and production integration remain separate from publishing this source repository.
